            2. What percentage of your team participated actively and was fully
            prepared most of the time?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A solid 50%. David was the only other member who showed up to any
            meetings - he was almost always prepared for the work we had to do.
          </p>

          <h3>
            3. Give one specific example of something you learned from the team
            that you probably would not have learned working alone.
          </h3>
          <p>
            David had a better understanding of "what looks good" than I did. He
            pushed me to make tougher changes to our design that I wasn't sure
            we could pull off.
          </p>
          <p>
            The menu, for example. In my original Figma mock-up, the menu would
            have been just a simple grid. David wanted to make it look more like
            a real restaurant menu - because of this, we ended up with a much
            more complicated design and I feel I learned a lot about nesting
            grids/flex boxes because of it.
          </p>

            4. Give one specific example of something the other team members
            learned from you that they probably would not have learned
            otherwise.
          </h3>
          <p>
            When we started, David claimed he had no idea how to make Javascript
            work with a web page. I hope I was able to teach him a little bit
            about how it works. (Though my understanding is not much better yet,
            plenty to learn!)

        <div class="question">
          <h3>
            5. Suggest at least one change the team could make to improve its
            performance or the project.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I feel our performance could have been increased by having the
            ability to work on the same code without needing to send files back
            and forth to each other. We could have both made edits whenever we
            had an idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            As it turns out, this technology totally exists in the form of a
            Visual Studio Code Extension - Live Share. I really wish I had
            thought to look for it during the actual project.

        <div class="question">
          <h3>1. What did you learn from the team sprint experience?</h3>
          <p>
            I learned that I needed even more practice with HTML and CSS. I had
            done all of the work we were given for/in class each day, but I
            definately needed more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even in doing this project, there's a clear difference in my skill
            and comfort level with everything from when I started to where I
            finished. I just wish I could've gone through the whole thing with
            what I've learned now!
          </p>
          <p>
            I have learned how to use Grid and Flex Box a lot better than I did
            before.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h3>2. What do you think went well?</h3>
          <p>
            The Javascript worked well. I was glad that I was able to make it
            dynamic - though I'm sure there's a more efficient way I could have
            done it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also felt like the Figma portion of our project was very effective
            - David and I were able to discuss our ideas and pick the parts we
            liked the most.

          </h3>
          <p>
            I would have given the restaurant more personality. I was hoping to
            have time at the end of the project to really customize it and make
            it unique, but there just wasn't time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would have also gone through the entire HTML code with a fine
            comb, looking for ways to improve our use of semantic tags.
            Everything felt like sucha rush - I really didn't make enough time
            for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, and I would have changed the cursor on the menu page to be a
            pointer when hovering over the menu items. I don't know how I forgot
            that.

          <p>
            Comment: It was tough with only two of us. We got through it, but I
            would love to see what we could've come up with if we had double the
            manpower.
          </p>
          <p>
            Comment: I spent the first couple of days feeling like I was just
            getting things to work through trial and error. After all this
            practice, though, I'm able to do up this assessment page without any
            difficulty at all. Progression feels good!
          </p>
          <p>
            Suggestion: Telling the students about the Live Share extension
            might be a good idea? I haven't tested it myself yet, but if it
            really does allow for multiple people to work simultaneously, it'd
            be invaluable.

            YouTube, Stack Overflow... too many Google searches to remember. I
            referenced the work we had done in class regularly. A lot of trial

            significantly as time went on.

            Notable mention goes to the online HTML validator that Noman showed

            4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so,
            how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you
            require)?

            I did not. I really thought about it for a while there, but I wanted
            to figure it out on my own.

            5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of the sprint from your own
            perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a
            similar but different sprint requiring some of the same techniques
            in the future now that you've completed this one.

            More difficult that it was probably intended to be, thanks to our
            group only having two people. BUT, we made the best of it, and I'm
            pretty happy with what we came up with.

            If I had to do a similar project again, I'd be much more confident.
            This was definately an educational experience for me, and I feel
            like I learned a lot about creating simple web pages.
